### Overview
Ultimate Home Run Derby is a baseball game where you have 10 outs to hit the baseball as far as you can, using the mouse as a baseball bat.

### Required Dependencies
- [Microsoft Windows, 64-bit](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) or MacOS
- [Visual Studio 2015](https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads?q=visual%20studio%202015&wt.mc_id=o%7Emsft%7Evscom%7Eolder-downloads)
- [Cinder v0.9.2 or greater](https://libcinder.org/download)
- [CLion](https://jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students) (Optional)

### Installation Instructions
- Download Visual Studio 2015 and Cinder using the links above.
- Clone the repository by pasting `git clone https://github.com/uiuc-fa20-cs126/final-project-manikjain314.git` into Terminal or Command Line, depending on your operating system.
- Build and run the project from your IDE.

### How to play
- Using your mouse as the bat, swing the bat and try to make contact with the ball to hit it as far as possible. 
- The further the ball is hit, the more points are scored. 
- Points are only earned when the ball is hit past the **left** edge of the screen. 
- Outs are recieved when the user fails to hit the ball beyond the left edge of the screen. 
- After 10 outs, the user's final score is calculated by the total distance the ball was hit.

### Code Style
- My code follows the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html). Note that built-in Cinder functions overridden and used do not follow this style.

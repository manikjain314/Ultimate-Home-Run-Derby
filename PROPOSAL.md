# PROJECT IDEA
For my final project, I want to create a game involving particle physics. My main idea was to make a baseball game, where the player plays as a batter and tries to hit as many home runs as possible. The UI will be drawn using Cinder, and multiple camera angles will be used to show the trajectory of the ball. 

# BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE
For 12 years, I have been playing baseball competitively and wanted to make something involving it. I also have a deep fascination in physics, and the Ideal Gas project really interested me in the fluidity of particle motion. I want to continue experimenting with particle physics to create something with an even greater degree of complexity. The curvature of the baseball bat the user will be swinging will also affect the trajectory of the ball, and I want to derive the calculations for the trajectory of the baseball myself and then implement it.

# TIMELINE
* **WEEK 1:** Design and implement the UI on the canvas. Begin creating a Ball class, and get the physics of the ball working properly. Also get keyboard/mouse interaction working properly.
* **WEEK 2:** Implement the GameEngine class, which connects everything to the UI on Cinder. Implement the physics of the baseball bat hitting the ball. Add score-counting based on distance the ball travelled, and other features if time allows. 
* **WEEK 3:** Implement multiple screens before and after the ball is hit. Add different kinds of baseball bats for the user to use, and calculate ball trajectory for each new bat added. Finish writing tests if needed.
* **EXTRA (If finished early):** Implement a two-player mode, or different game modes for the user to play.
